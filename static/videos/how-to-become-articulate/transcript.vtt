00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
You once said, the most dangerous person is one who is articulate.

00:05.000 --> 00:13.000
What would you recommend to a one who wants to learn to speak in a more articulate manner?

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Articulate is an interesting word, because if your joints are articulated,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
and that means you can do things with them, because they're articulated.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
They're not one solid, vague mass.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
They're differentiated, and someone who's graceful is articulated,

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
and compelling because they're articulated,

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
and speech is a form of articulation in that manner,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
because the act of speech itself is extremely complicated.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
It's a very complicated motor activity, right?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
It's a very complicated action to dance with your tongue, let's say.

01:00.000 --> 01:12.000
And it is definitely the case that there is no more exceptional form of the capacity to be dangerous than to be articulate.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
And one of the things that really shocks me,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
part of the reason that my son and I, and our co-workers developed this essay app,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
is that young men in particular never taught this.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
It's like, well, why be literate?

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, do you want to be competent and dangerous, or do you want to be vague and useless?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Because those are your options, and I don't care what your job is,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
it doesn't matter what you end up doing.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
You know, if you're a plumber, great respect for plumbers, by the way,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
and you're articulate, you can negotiate with your clients,

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
you can introduce your co-workers, you can make a case for your employees,

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
you can advertise your services, you can think through your problems,

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
you're firing on all cylinders.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
You know, our whole culture is based on the idea of the supremacy of the word,

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
our whole culture is based on the idea that it is the word itself that extracts habitable order from chaos and possibility.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
And the reason our culture is predicated on that is because it's a deep truth,

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
and to the degree that our culture actually embodies that, it works.

02:32.000 --> 02:43.000
So, it's a great thing to be articulate, and it would be so lovely if our educators were wise enough

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
to communicate this appropriately to young men who are striving forward

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
and to let them know in no uncertain terms that if they want to make themselves into forces to be contended with,

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
that there's no sure route to that than an exceptional poetic literacy.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Now, it's not like young people don't have an intuition of this,

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
there are reasons they admire rap musicians, for example, who are often extraordinarily articulate

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
in their performance and their capacity for spontaneous poetic utterance.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
And certainly the greatest people I've met, including great warriors, you might say,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
are great in no small part because they're articulate.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
I know a former special services, special operations soldier, Jocko Willink,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
some of you might know about Jocko.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
He's got a pretty decent online following, and he's about four feet wide and about three feet thick,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
and he's one tough son of a bitch, I'll tell you.

03:52.000 --> 04:01.000
You don't want to mess with him, and he knows perfectly well and is very capable of articulating

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
the fact that his success as an eminent warrior is in no small part dependent on his ability to communicate.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
Because he could communicate well, he could listen to the men who were under his command

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
because he was articulate, he could explain to his superiors the situation on the ground

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
because he was articulate, he could make a case that the men under his command

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
who were deserving would be promoted because he could think in an articulate manner

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
he could plan strategically and not lose battles.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Okay, so that's the case for being articulate.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
And what's the alternative?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
You want to be in articulate?

04:45.000 --> 04:54.000
You want to say ah and like and mmm and pause and stumble and be unable to formulate a strategy,

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
be unable to elucidate a vision, be unable to compel and convince other people to entice them

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
with your articulated vision of what might be?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
You want the opposite of that?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
That's why would you want that?

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
You would choose awkwardness over grace?

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
It's preposterous.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
It's beyond foolish.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
And I cannot understand for the life of me why this case isn't made in a compelling manner, particularly to young men.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
And I know it's not being articulated to young men because they're dropping out of the educational realm in droves.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And it's unbelievably sad.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
So how do you become articulate?

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, by paying attention to what you say, that's a good start.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And what do I mean by that?

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
I mean pay attention to what you say.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
So you can think of this as an analogy.

06:12.000 --> 06:20.000
So imagine that you're trying to walk across a swamp and the swamp is murky.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
But you know there's a path.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
You know there's a path of stone under the water, but it twists and moves.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
And if you stay on the path, you won't drown.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
The crocodiles in the swamp won't devour you.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
And as you walk forward, you can feel with your next step where the stone might be.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
And then you feel it solid, then you take that step and then you do the same thing with your foot again.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
You search and you find out what's solid and you step on it and you move forward in that manner.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
That's what you do with your words.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
It's the same thing.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
You feel and you feel, is this the right word?

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
Is it the fact that I'm uttering it, putting me together and making me intact and stronger?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Or is it tearing me apart and making me disillute and weak?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
And you can learn to do that.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I learned this in part from reading Carl Rogers, who's a great clinician.

07:25.000 --> 07:34.000
Rogers believed that the integration of language and action was a necessary precondition

07:34.000 --> 07:44.000
for operation as an effective clinician, that you had to align what you said with who you were.

07:44.000 --> 07:53.000
And that one of the things that your clients would be evaluating you for was that capability.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
And you might say that someone with that capability manifests themselves as genuine and trustworthy.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
And more than that, I would say also as compelling and interesting, although that can be gamed.

08:08.000 --> 08:19.000
But the entire combination that emerges out of the domain of articulate communication can't be gamed.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
It's not easily.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You feel your way.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
I noticed 40 years ago when I started thinking these things through that much of what I said actually made me feel weak.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
I didn't know why exactly, but sometimes some of the things I said didn't have that effect.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
They weren't accompanied by a sense of shame, let's say.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
They weren't accompanied with a sense of vulnerability.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
They were solid.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
And at the beginning, that was probably only about 5% of what I said.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The rest of it was instrumental.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
It was language I was using to get my way in the manner that Tammy described when she introduced me tonight.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
There was an arrogance in my use of language that had to do with the desire to attain proximal victories, right?

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
To appear smart, let's say, to win an argument, something like that.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
It's a very different idea than merely feeling my way along to see what word was appropriate for what moment.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
But you can learn to do that.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And you can listen to yourself.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
And you can stop humming and hawing and using like and you know and fillers.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And you can take the time necessary to craft your words carefully.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
And you can practice merely saying what you believe to be true.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
And you can read.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And you can read great writers.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
And you can write.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
And you can write about what you think about the problems that obsess you.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And you can become articulate as a consequence.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
And there'll be nothing about that that isn't the adventure of your life.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And so it's a moral endeavor in some real sense.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
To become articulate is to become the master of your own tongue.

10:10.000 --> 10:23.000
And to become properly articulate is to make the word divine.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And to treat it in that manner.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
And to decide whether or not you believe that it is the case that the divine word creates the order that's habitable and good.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
And if you do believe that, well if you don't believe that, then what do you believe?

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And if you do believe that, well, go all in.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
See what happens.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
See what happens if you become articulate.

10:55.000 --> 11:08.000
I'll give you one more small example.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Tammy touched on this in the introduction too.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
She said she'd learned to pause.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
You can pause.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
It's a prayerful pause in some sense.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
When you're in a discussion with someone, you can ask yourself.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
They might present you with a question or a conundrum or a proposition.

11:29.000 --> 11:38.000
And instead of responding with what you know to be right, so to speak, you could just ask yourself, what do I actually think about that?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But it has to be a real question.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
It has to be the kind of question that you'd pose to someone you didn't know.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
It has to be a question predicated on the idea that you might not know who you are.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And that you could ask.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
So someone will present you with a question.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
You think, okay, what do I think about that?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
But you have to want to know the answer.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
And then the answer will make itself known because that's how thought works.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
And then you can just communicate that answer.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
And if you do that, you'll be interesting right away.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You'll be interesting to the person that you're talking to.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And if they do that to you, they'll be interesting too.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And then if you both do that, you'll have an interesting conversation.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And if you have an interesting conversation, you'll both grow as a consequence.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
And that's actually the pathway to growth.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And you just wait.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
You can wait.

12:31.000 --> 12:45.000
You can open yourself up to the possibility that what needs to be said will make itself manifest if that's what you are striving for, if that's what you're asking for.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And then you can merely communicate that.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
You have to abandon instrumentality to do that.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
So one of the reasons Joe Rogan is so successful, by the way, is that that's what Joe does.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
He just asks questions.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
He isn't trying to get something from his guests.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
He's not trying to become more famous.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
He doesn't need any more money.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
There's no instrumental utilization of language in his discourse.

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
He's just a humble, long head, you know, in the most profound sense, who would like to know more than he knows,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
and who asks all the stupid questions he can think up.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.000
And it turns out that he's actually very, very smart and very well educated now,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
after talking to hundreds and hundreds of people and listening.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And so the stupid questions he asks aren't stupid.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And they're questions that are shared by virtually everyone who's listening.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
And he takes his listeners along on this process of exploratory endeavor,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
and it's the pathway to success.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
And the same thing can be true of your life.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
The pathway to success is much...

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
If you're guided by the spirit of honest inquiry,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
and every word you say is reflective of what you believe to be the truth,

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
then the pathway that you walk on is a golden pathway to success.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And I know that.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I know that to be true.
