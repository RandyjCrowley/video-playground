I've worked in emergency medicine for 11 years and I've seen a lot of death yet

00:06.560 --> 00:13.400
I'm so afraid of dying. Any advice on how I can be at peace with dying and mortality?

00:16.240 --> 00:19.440
Well, I don't know if anybody's ever really at peace with that.

00:20.160 --> 00:26.240
I mean, I think what you can take away, read Socrates' Apology. There's two versions of it. There's

00:26.960 --> 00:33.840
there's the Plato's version and there's, what was his name? Aristophanes? There's another version.

00:33.840 --> 00:39.040
I don't think that's right. Anyways, there's two versions of Socrates' Apology. It's very short.

00:39.040 --> 00:46.640
It's only a few pages long, 15 pages or something. Read them both. Why? Well,

00:46.640 --> 00:51.440
because Socrates puts together, puts forward a very interesting proposition and I don't really

00:51.680 --> 00:59.040
know really what to make of it. So I asked my parents once if they could take a drug that would

00:59.040 --> 01:05.760
return them to being 18 physically, but they can take, they had all the wisdom that they'd accrued

01:05.760 --> 01:12.480
over the years. They wouldn't lose that if they would do it. And they didn't say yes right away.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.640
You know, and I don't know if they ever did tell me what they had decided, but it was interesting

01:18.640 --> 01:23.360
to me that they didn't say, they didn't say no right away either, you know, but it's interesting

01:23.360 --> 01:28.320
that they had to think about it because you'd think that if you were offered something approximating

01:28.320 --> 01:34.400
immortality and health, you'd take it. And maybe you would, but, but then here's an alternative

01:34.400 --> 01:40.000
proposition and I don't know. It's not like I'm not trying to maintain myself, you know, if I could

01:40.720 --> 01:45.600
extract out an extra decade or an extra 20 years, keeping myself healthy, that seems like a good

01:45.600 --> 01:55.120
thing. Would I want to live 500 years? That's a long time, man. A thousand years? I don't know.

01:55.760 --> 02:01.600
That's a long time, but the alternative is, you know, truncated existence with death.

02:02.400 --> 02:10.880
And that's also not particularly palatable. And so is there a medicament for mortality?

02:10.880 --> 02:17.360
Well, Socrates, what implicit in Socrates' apology is the following idea. Imagine you

02:17.360 --> 02:25.440
lived your life fully, and that would mean that you, you said what you had to say when you had to

02:25.440 --> 02:32.080
say it, you did what you needed to do when you needed to do it, and you availed yourself of

02:32.080 --> 02:39.280
every opportunity that came your way, right? So you'd exhaust yourself in the service of your life,

02:39.280 --> 02:46.640
let's say. Maybe by the time you were old, you'd have had enough, you know, and you could just

02:46.640 --> 02:52.720
let go. And you know, you do see this with people is that, and we kind of know this even when we

02:52.720 --> 02:58.880
grieve, you know, maybe you have a relative who's 95 and they die and people are sad, but you say,

02:58.880 --> 03:05.520
well, you know, they live the full life and the fuller the life, the less, in some ways, the less

03:06.480 --> 03:14.800
catastrophic the demise appears to be. And so it might be that if you fully exhausted yourself,

03:16.480 --> 03:26.160
that your life would be enough. So I know, you know, people, I said, I mentioned this already,

03:26.160 --> 03:30.960
people who are old and they look back in their life, they're often sorrowful and regretful for

03:30.960 --> 03:36.560
the things they didn't do, you know, the things they left undone, and maybe now can't do, you know,

03:37.360 --> 03:41.680
you could imagine those of you who've been parents, maybe have grown kids now, you think, well,

03:41.680 --> 03:49.360
if you could have children again, would you? And maybe the answer is yes, but another answer is,

03:49.360 --> 04:00.160
well, you know, I had kids already, I already did that. And if you did that, well, maybe that's

04:00.160 --> 04:05.040
enough. You know, we have grandkids now and that's not exactly the same as having kids, it's sort of,

04:05.040 --> 04:12.400
it's kids light, right? And it's wonderful. But you made a joke about that when you were on stage,

04:12.400 --> 04:17.440
you know, you said they have all the advantages of children, grandchildren with none of the

04:17.440 --> 04:22.400
disadvantages and that's a joke, but everybody laughs because everybody gets that and it's great

04:22.400 --> 04:27.600
to have grandchildren and like, would we return to our youth and do it again?

04:31.200 --> 04:35.520
Well, that's a very difficult question to answer, right? Because you just, well, you just don't

04:35.520 --> 04:42.320
have the, you can't tell what you decided unless that option was actually available to you. And

04:42.320 --> 04:48.400
maybe the answer is yes, and maybe the answer is no, because, you know, being there, done that,

04:48.480 --> 04:53.680
onto whatever the next thing is. And so I would say, if you're afraid of death,

04:54.960 --> 05:02.240
take a look at how you're living and see if, if you're all in, and maybe if you're all in enough,

05:02.960 --> 05:08.720
that's good enough. I think that's right. I think that's right. And then I think also,

05:08.720 --> 05:16.560
if you're all in and death visits and you know it's impending, you could say to yourself,

05:16.880 --> 05:22.480
I did everything that I was here to do, at least then you're not going to torture yourself with that

05:22.480 --> 05:25.520
as you're facing death. That's something too.
