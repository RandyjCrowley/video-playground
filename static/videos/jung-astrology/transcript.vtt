00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Part of what we're going to talk about here is how astrology informs the therapy process

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.640
and what that actually looks like. I think one of your observations is that there are some

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:19.440
people that are primarily psychotherapists that do incorporate astrology to some extent in their

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.040
work. While that's not a huge portion of the field necessarily, it's interesting that that

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.159
exists and it's something that's not necessarily widely recognized. It would be interesting to

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:41.040
look into how that works and what that's about. Yes. I would love to share with you a few quotes

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.000
from Carl Jung about his process of using astrology in psychotherapy. I think this is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.759
the other thing. We're like, oh yeah, Carl Jung, he valued astrology, but did he actually use it?

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.400
Did he use the chart in his process? Did he talk to his clients about it? Those are the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.239
kinds of things I want to know. What did he actually do? We don't have a lot on that,

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:21.199
unfortunately, but there's a couple of things. Let's see. Two different core quotes that I'll

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:30.800
share. Carl Jung wrote in a letter in 1911 to Freud. This is very early on in his studies.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.800
This may be a popular one that folks have heard. He says,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.400
my evenings are taken up very largely with astrology. I make horoscopic calculations in

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.839
order to find the clue to the core of psychological truth. That to me says that he's pulling a chart

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:52.160
and he's looking at it to assess his understanding of the client case.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:00.239
I love that quote because he's writing that to Freud and I always just imagine Freud rolling his

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:10.160
eyes and being like, okay. That's one of the core quotes and that's from super early in Jung's

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:22.000
career. I think this is also quite popular, but it bears repeating. Carl Jung wrote in a letter to

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:28.240
an astrologer, B. V. Raman. This is in 1947. This is fairly late in his career.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.080
He said, since you want to know my opinion about astrology, I can tell you I've been interested in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.399
this particular activity of the human mind for more than 30 years. In cases of difficult

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:47.839
psychological diagnosis, I usually get a horoscope in order to have a further point of view from an

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:54.000
entirely different angle. I must say that very often I found that the astrological data

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.880
elucidated certain points which I otherwise would have been unable to understand. From such

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.119
experiences, I form the opinion that astrology is of particular interest to the psychologist.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:15.839
Yeah, for sure. Then he's also writing the papers on synchronicity and he's doing his

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:22.000
astrology test during those or at least during one of those. It keeps coming up at different

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.399
points in his life. I've done other episodes going in more detail about Jung's background in

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:34.559
astrology, but I think the conclusion with those was that there was no â€“ I don't want to say no

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.520
question, but it seemed like it was easy to classify him as an astrologer, although obviously

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.880
he was primarily a psychotherapist. Yeah, I think from what I can tell,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.839
it's definitely something that he used to inform his understanding, but maybe not necessarily with

00:03:51.839 --> 00:04:00.160
clients.
