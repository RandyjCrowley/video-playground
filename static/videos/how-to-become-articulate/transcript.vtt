00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You once said, the most dangerous person is one who is articulate.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What would you recommend to one who wants to learn to speak in a more articulate manner?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, articulate is an interesting word, eh? Because if your joints are articulated,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that means you can do things with them, because they're articulated, right?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They're not one solid, vague mass.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They're differentiated. And someone who's graceful is articulated.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And compelling, because they're articulated.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And speech is a form of articulation in that manner, because the act of speech itself is extremely complicated.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's a very complicated motor activity, right?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's a very complicated action to dance with your tongue, let's say.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And it is definitely the case that there is no more exceptional form of the capacity to be dangerous than to be articulate.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And one of the things that really shocks me, part of the reason that my son and I and our co-workers developed this essay app,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is that young men in particular are never taught this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's like, well, why learn to... why be literate?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, do you want to be competent and dangerous, or do you want to be vague and useless?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Because those are your options, and I don't care what your job is.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It doesn't matter what you end up doing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, if you're a plumber, great respect for plumbers, by the way, and you're articulate,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you can negotiate with your clients, you can introduce your co-workers, you can make a case for your employees,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
you can advertise your services, you can think through your problems.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You're firing on all cylinders.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You know, our whole culture is based on the idea of the supremacy of the word.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Our whole culture is based on the idea that it is the word itself that extracts habitable order from chaos and possibility.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And the reason our culture is predicated on that is because it's a deep truth,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and to the degree that our culture actually embodies that, it works.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So, it's a great thing to be articulate.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And it would be so lovely if our educators were wise enough to communicate this appropriately

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to young men who are striving forward, and to let them know in no uncertain terms

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that if they want to make themselves into forces to be contended with,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that there's no surer route to that than an exceptional poetic literacy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now, it's not like young people don't have an intuition of this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There are reasons they admire rap musicians, for example,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000
who are often extraordinarily articulate in their performance and their capacity for spontaneous poetic utterance.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And certainly, the greatest people I've met, including great warriors, you might say,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
are great in no small part because they're articulate.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I know a former Special Services, Special Operations soldier, Jocko Willink.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Some of you might know about Jocko.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He's got a pretty decent online following, and he's about four feet wide and about three feet thick,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and he's one tough son of a bitch, I'll tell you.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You don't want to mess with him, and he knows perfectly well

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and is very capable of articulating the fact that his success as an eminent warrior

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
is in no small part dependent on his ability to communicate.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Because he could communicate well, he could listen to the men who were under his command.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Because he was articulate, he could explain to his superiors the situation on the ground.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Because he was articulate, he could make a case that the men under his command,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
who were deserving, would be promoted.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Because he could think in an articulate manner, he could plan strategically and not lose battles.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Okay, so that's the case for being articulate.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And what's the alternative? You want to be inarticulate?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You want to say, ah, and like, and mmm, and pause, and stumble,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and be unable to formulate a strategy, be unable to elucidate a vision,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.000
be unable to compel and convince other people to entice them with your articulated vision of what might be?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
You want the opposite of that?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Why would you want that?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You would choose awkwardness over grace?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It's preposterous.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It's beyond foolish.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I cannot understand for the life of me why this case isn't made in a compelling manner,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
particularly to young men.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And I know it's not being articulated to young men,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
because they're dropping out of the educational realm in droves.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And it's unbelievably sad.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So, how do you become articulate?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Well, by paying attention to what you say.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That's a good start.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And what do I mean by that?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I mean pay attention to what you say.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So, you can think of this as an analogy.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, imagine that you're trying to walk across a swamp, and the swamp is murky.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But you know there's a path.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
You know there's a path of stone under the water.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But it twists and moves.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And if you stay on the path, you won't drown.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The crocodiles in the swamp won't devour you.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And as you walk forward, you can feel with your next step where the stone might be.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And then you feel it's solid.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Then you take that step, and then you do the same thing with your foot again.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You search, and you find out what's solid, and you step on it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And you move forward in that manner.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
That's what you do with your words.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's the same thing.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You feel, and you feel.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Is this the right word?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Is the fact that I'm uttering it putting me together and making me intact and stronger,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or is it tearing me apart and making me dissolute and weak?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And you can learn to do that.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I learned this in part from reading Carl Rogers, who's a great clinician.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And Rogers believed that the integration of language and action

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
was a necessary precondition for operation as an effective clinician.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
That you had to align what you said with who you were.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And that one of the things that your clients would be evaluating you for was that capability.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And you might say that someone with that capability manifests themselves as genuine and trustworthy.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And more than that, I would say also as compelling and interesting.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Although that can be gamed.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:03.000
But the entire combination that emerges out of the domain of articulate communication can't be gamed.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It's not easily.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You feel your way.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I noticed 40 years ago, when I started thinking these things through,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that much of what I said actually made me feel weak.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I didn't know why, exactly.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And some of the things I said didn't have that effect.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
They weren't accompanied by a sense of shame, let's say.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They weren't accompanied with a sense of vulnerability.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They were solid.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And at the beginning, that was probably only about 5% of what I said.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The rest of it was instrumental.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It was language I was using to get my way in the manner that Tammy described

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
when she introduced me tonight.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
There was an arrogance in my use of language that had to do with the desire to attain proximal victories, right?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
To appear smart, let's say.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
To win an argument.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Something like that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
A very different idea than merely feeling my way along to see what word was appropriate for what moment.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But you can learn to do that.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And you can listen to yourself.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And you can stop humming and hawing and using like and you know and fillers.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And you can take the time necessary to craft your words carefully.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And you can practice merely saying what you believe to be true.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And you can read.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And you can read great writers.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And you can write.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And you can write about what you think about the problems that obsess you.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And you can become articulate as a consequence.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And there'll be nothing about that that isn't the adventure of your life.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And so it's a moral endeavor in some real sense.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
To become articulate is to become the master of your own tongue.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And to become properly articulate is to make the word divine.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:06.359
and to treat it in that manner, and to decide whether or not you believe that it is the case that

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:10.559
the divine word creates the order that's habitable and good.

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:16.359
And if you do believe that, well, if you don't believe that, then what do you believe?

00:10:16.359 --> 00:10:21.359
And if you do believe that, well, go all in.

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:26.359
See what happens. See what happens if you become articulate.

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:40.359
I'll give you one more small example. Tammy touched on this in the introduction, too.

00:10:40.359 --> 00:10:48.359
She said she'd learned to pause. You can pause. It's a prayerful pause in some sense.

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:52.359
When you're in a discussion with someone, you can ask yourself.

00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:57.359
They might present you with a question or a conundrum or a proposition,

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:02.359
and instead of responding with what you know to be right, so to speak,

00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:06.359
you could just ask yourself, what do I actually think about that?

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:12.359
But it has to be a real question. It has to be the kind of question that you'd pose to someone you didn't know.

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:18.359
It has to be a question predicated on the idea that you might not know who you are, and that you could ask.

00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:25.359
And so someone will present you with a question. You think, okay, what do I think about that?

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:29.359
But you have to want to know the answer, and then the answer will make itself known,

00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:34.359
because that's how thought works, and then you can just communicate that answer.

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:38.359
And if you do that, you'll be interesting right away.

00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:41.359
You'll be interesting to the person that you're talking to.

00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:44.359
And if they do that to you, they'll be interesting, too.

00:11:44.359 --> 00:11:47.359
And then if you both do that, you'll have an interesting conversation.

00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:51.359
If you have an interesting conversation, you'll both grow as a consequence,

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:54.359
and that's actually the pathway to growth.

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:56.359
And you just wait. You can wait.

00:11:56.359 --> 00:12:03.359
You can open yourself up to the possibility that what needs to be said will make itself manifest,

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:09.359
if that's what you are striving for, if that's what you're asking for.

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:12.359
And then you can merely communicate that.

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:15.359
You have to abandon instrumentality to do that.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:19.359
So, one of the reasons Joe Rogan is so successful, by the way,

00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:22.359
is that that's what Joe does.

00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:24.359
He just asks questions.

00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:28.359
He isn't trying to get something from his guests.

00:12:28.359 --> 00:12:30.359
He's not trying to become more famous.

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:32.359
He doesn't need any more money.

00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:36.359
There's no instrumental utilization of language in his discourse.

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:42.359
He's just a humble lunkhead, you know, in the most profound sense,

00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:45.359
who would like to know more than he knows,

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:49.359
and who asks all the stupid questions he can think up.

00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:52.359
And it turns out that he's actually very, very smart,

00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:56.359
and very well educated now,

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.359
after talking to hundreds and hundreds of people and listening.

00:12:59.359 --> 00:13:02.359
And so the stupid questions he asks aren't stupid,

00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:06.359
and they're questions that are shared by virtually everyone who's listening.

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:11.359
And he takes his listeners along on this process of exploratory endeavor,

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:14.359
and it's the pathway to success.

00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:17.359
And the same thing can be true of your life.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:22.359
The pathway to success is much...

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:24.359
It's a...

00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:27.359
If you're guided by the spirit of honest inquiry,

00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:32.359
and every word you say is reflective of what you believe to be the truth,

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:37.359
then the pathway that you walk on is a golden pathway to success.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:42.359
And I know that. I know that to be true.
